the receiver. 
this course will be in three parts.
the receiver , the baud generator and the transmitter.

the receiver sub circuit is made up of the main receiver and the baud generator. 
the baud generator generates the clock signal which is used to synchronize the receiver subcircuit. 
the receiver ports consists of the 
stop bit which is kept high all the time .
rx  bit which is where we connected our received bit.
clear to send signal which turns the receiver on  , for data reception .
baud clock which comes from the baud generator. 
the reset .
error signal , which signals if there are errors during data reception. 
the din data bits which is the received bits. 
then clr clk signal which is used for over sampling. 
we will discuss over sampling during the baud generator class.

the baud generator ports consists of the baud select which is used to select the baud rate.
clock and reset for synchronising and resetting the circuit .
clr clock signal used for oversampling. 
and one output which is the baud clock.

the vhdl code for the mapping between the receiver and baud generator is shown next.

First is the vhdl standard libraries. 
next is the  receiver ports .

then the baud generator and main receiver components and their ports .

finally their mapping.

we have three signal lines.

the clr clock signal line, 
baud clock signal line and the reset signal line. next let us now dive into this receiver main circuit and see what logic gates it is made up of . I

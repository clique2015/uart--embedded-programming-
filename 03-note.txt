AT this point, before we continue I will make some assumptions.

1. You have downloaded logism
2. You have downloaded and installed a vhdl/verilog code editor
3. You have downloaded the courses zipped materials including:
   The vhdl codes.
   The course sub titles, incase my voice is not clear or audible.
   The logism circuit diagram.

In this lesson. We will now see what is contained inside transmitter.

then we will learn the vhdl code.

Please hope you have basic knowledge of logism, 
all you need to know is basucally what each component represents.

from the this picture, the tx fsm and the tx bit count are both signals.
they are not ports,
but i have used them as input and output for demonstrative purposes.
they do not reflect on the transmitter.

the transmitter has for stages. 
Which is controlled by the TX FSM signal. 
a 2bit register is used to store the tx fsm signal.

Which stand for transmitter finite state machine .
when the txfsm  signal is zero . that is stage zero. the transmitter is in idle state.
nothing happens .
when the rts signal is turned on,  it moves to stage 1.
here, the transmission occurs, while the ts fsm signal alternates between stage 1 and stage 2.
transmission occurs at stage 1 and 2.

here, the tx bit count signal counts the number of sent data. 
if it is equal to the number of total data to be sent . in our case 19bits.
the comparator turns on, which detects that it has completely transmitted all data bits.
and moves from stage 1 or stage 2 , to stage 3.

At stage 3 which is the final stage, if the stop signal is on . the circuit halts else it moves to stage zero .

and everything starts afresh.
